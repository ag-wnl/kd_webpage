                A child possesses the most beautiful memories from their childhood. Childhood is the most precious time of a child’s life. It is a phase of getting familiar with the surroundings and learning new things. But what if this beautiful journey is obstructed by someone with wrong intentions, will it be memorable anymore? No, it won’t.  


                <div>
                We are talking about Child Abuse. When a child is abused, their childhood becomes a nightmare. It becomes something they don’t want to remember, as the thoughts are enough to cause distress and pain.

                Our vision is to create a society where children can live a peaceful life without the fear of being abused. A society where we have successful and happy children rather than a traumatized and depressed generation of children. We want everyone to not think of child abuse as taboo and talk about it freely, without any fear. We aim to eradicate child abuse from our society and punish the offenders with the most brutal consequences so that no one dares to do something horrible to another innocent soul.
